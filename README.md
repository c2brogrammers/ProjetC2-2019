### OVERVIEW
MyDr is revolutionising the local healthcare market, enabling patients to search, book and review medical specialists online.

### PURPOSE
Rooted in our experience and understanding of both the personal and professional sides of healthcare, we are driven by a passionate belief that technology can greatly enhance the relationship between patients and health specialists. We strive to nurture and improve the understanding between patients and health specialists â€“ because a better relationship can only make for better healthcare.
